Points to rememer whilem doing the recursive questions including vectors:
1. in the base case always pass the empty vector ..so that the answer could build ..if you pass vector with size 1 .. it will auto matically include 0 at the end.

Eg:- vector<int> base(0);
	 return base;

2. In case of string :
	string base = "";
	return base;
